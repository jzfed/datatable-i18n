I18N Data Table Project
====

- Requirement
  - Cell phone column can be edited when double clicked
  - Clicking the column labe would sort the column alphabatically
  - When the selector of the first column and the first row is checked, all rows are selected
  - Clicking the Delete button will delete the selected rows
  - Update will cause the Ajax invocation to update the modified rows.  For now just pop up a alert panel showing the rows you are to update
  - Add will add an empty row to fill in the data except the ID, which will be filled after updating
  - Think of how to localize this

- Todo List
  - [x] Find the example
  - [ ] Develop the simple version
  - [ ] How to implement the i18n

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
